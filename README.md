# Open Synthetic Patient Data
Open data of synthetic patients for machine learning (ML) and learning health systems (LHS).

Although there are some freely-available large EHR datasets such as MIMIC-III and CPRD, they require qualified applications. In order to make it easier for developers to obtain synthetic patient data free of privacy concerns, this open data repository is created for the community to share synthetic data. The initial datasets are synthetic Synthea patient data for ML and LHS simulation experiments. **You welcome to add your synthetic data in the repository.**

With these open synthetic datasets, researchers may find it useful in developing ML algorithms, building ML-enabled LHS processes, testing, training, and collaborations. After first using synthetic data to develop new processes and then applying them to real EHR data, you may find the new "synthetic+real" strategy more efficient in solving certain types of problems. 

The datasets were used in the first LHS simulation study - "Simulation of a machine learning enabled learning health system for risk prediction using synthetic patient data", which was published in Nature Scientific Reports (see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23011-4). 
To learn more about LHS, please check out the open [LHS Practical Guide](https://github.com/lhs-open/lhs-guide).

## ML-ready Synthea patient datasets

Synthea synthetic patient data were generated by the [Synthea patient generator tool](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea). The EHR records were processed to ML-ready datasets for machine learning. If the continuous numeric values are converted to categoricacl values, the data file name has "convert" in it.

The same datasets are also available in Harvard Dataverse: [Synthetic Patient Data ML Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/synthetic-patient-ml).

### For lung cancer risk prediction machine learning

- Five lung cancer datasets (pt30k*), each from 30K patients, are available here for machine learning 
- Due to the file size limit by github, the complete collection of datasets from 30k to 150K Synthea patients is publicly available from [Mendeley Data repository](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/b24cb4nn8h/1). They were used to simulate ML-LHS in the Nature paper.
