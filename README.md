# Open Synthetic Patient Data
Open data of synthetic Synthea patients for machine learning (ML) and learning health systems (LHS).

Although there are a few freely-available large EHR datasets such as MIMIC-III and CPRD, they require qualified applications. In order to make it easier for developers to obtain ML-ready EHR data to work on ML and LHS without privacy concerns, this LHS open data project created synthetic Synthea patient data for ML and LHS simulation experiments. 

The first LHS simulation study titled "Simulation of a machine learning enabled learning health system for risk prediction using synthetic patient data" has been published in Nature Scientific Reports journal (see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23011-4). 
To learn more about LHS, please check out the practical [LHS Quick Guide](https://github.com/lhs-open/lhs-guide).

With these open synthetic datasets, researchers may find it useful in development and testing ML algorithms, constructing ML-enabled LHS, ML/LHS training, and collaboration across hospitals.  After using synthetic data to develop new processes first and then applying them to real EHR data, you may find this new approach more efficient in solving certain types of problems. (Let me know if you want to dicuss this synthetic+real data approach. -aj)   

## ML-ready Synthea patient datasets

Synthea synthetic patient data were generated by the [Synthea patient generator tool](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea). The EHR records were processed to ML-ready datasets for lung cancer risk prediction. The lung cancer datasets (pt30k) from 30K patients are available here at github. Due to the file size limit by github, the complete collection of datasets from 150K Synthea patients is publicly available from Mendeley Data repository (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/b24cb4nn8h/1).
